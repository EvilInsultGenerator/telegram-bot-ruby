### Installation

Clone this repository to your local machine
`git clone https://github.com/EvilInsultGenerator/telegram-bot-ruby.git`
For the first you need to install gems required to start a bot:
`bundle install`
Then you need to create `secrets.yml` where your bot unique tokens will be stored and `database.yml` where database credentials will be stored.
```ruby
#config/database.yml
adapter: postgresql
database: *your_DB_name*
encoding: unicode
pool: 5
timeout: 5000
```
```ruby
#config/secrets.yml
telegram_bot_token: *your_bot_token*
botan_token: *your_botan_token*
```
Then you need to fill your Telegram bot unique token to the `secrets.yml` file and your database credentials to `database.yml`.

After this you need to create and migrate your database:
`rake db:create db:migrate`
Great!
Now you can easily start your bot just by running this command:
`bin/bot`
